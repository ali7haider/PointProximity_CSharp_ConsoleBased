# PointProximity_CSharp_ConsoleBased

PointProximity is a simple console-based application implemented in C# with file-handling capabilities. It offers various features for calculating distances between points, determining linear gradients, and finding distances from zero coordinates.

## Features
1. **Make a Line**: Create a new line by specifying the coordinates for its beginning and end points.
2. **Update a Begin Point**: Modify the starting point of the line by entering new coordinates for it.
3. **Update an End Point**: Change the coordinates of the endpoint of the line.
4. **Show the Update Point**: Display the current coordinates of the beginning point of the line after any updates.
5. **Show the End Point**: View the current coordinates of the endpoint of the line.
6. **Get the Length of Line**: Calculate and display the length of the line based on its beginning and end points.
7. **Get the Gradient of Line**: Determine the gradient (slope) of the line.
8. **Find the Distance of the Begin Point from Zero Coordinates**: Calculate the distance between the beginning point of the line and the origin.
9. **Find the Distance of End Point from Zero Coordinates**: Calculate the distance between the endpoint of the line and the origin.
10. **Exit**: End the current session and exit the application.

## Usage
To use PointProximity Console, simply choose from the available options presented in the console interface. Follow the prompts to input coordinates and perform calculations as needed.
